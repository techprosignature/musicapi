# musicapi

`musicapi` mirrors public metadata and media URLs exposed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints music library. It also produces a smaller, stable catalog for static clients such as Living Music.

This is an independent project. It is not an official Church API and is not affiliated with or endorsed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

## Published API

GitHub Pages publishes only the optimized catalog. Raw source responses remain in the repository for validation and rebuilding, but they are not part of the public Pages artifact.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/index.json` | Small discovery document pointing to the current API version |
| `/v1/index.json` | Collections, counts, revisions, and search metadata |
| `/v1/search.json` | Lightweight global song-search records |
| `/v1/collections/<collection>.json` | Normalized songs and recordings for one collection |

Apps may start with `/index.json` to discover the current version or request `/v1/index.json` directly when pinned to version 1. Relative `href` values include a deterministic revision query, allowing normal browser caching while fetching new content immediately after the index changes.

Fetch the search index only when global search is used, and fetch a collection only when it is opened. The catalog schema has an integer `schemaVersion`; consumers must reject unsupported versions rather than guessing.

```js
const apiRoot = new URL("https://living-music.github.io/musicapi/");
const manifest = await fetch(new URL("index.json", apiRoot)).then((response) => response.json());
const indexUrl = new URL(manifest.href, apiRoot);
const index = await fetch(indexUrl).then((response) => response.json());

// Resolve these against indexUrl because they are relative to the version directory.
const searchUrl = new URL(index.search.href, indexUrl);
const firstCollectionUrl = new URL(index.collections[0].href, indexUrl);
```

Cache search and collection responses using their `revision` values. A changed revision produces a changed query string in `href`, while unchanged content keeps the same URL.

Song IDs use `<collection-slug>:<song-slug>`. Store favorites by song ID. Recording IDs add the normalized recording type. A song contains its default artwork; a recording contains `artworkUrl` only when that version has meaningfully different source artwork. Media remains hosted by the Church; this repository stores URLs and metadata, not audio files.

## Commands

Node.js 22 or newer is required. There are no package dependencies.

```sh
npm run validate
npm run build
npm run refresh
```

- `validate` checks that every advertised collection exists, totals match, song IDs are unique, audio URLs are HTTPS, and the compact catalog agrees with the raw mirror.
- `build` regenerates the compact catalog from the checked-in raw mirror without network access.
- `refresh` downloads a complete snapshot into a temporary directory, validates it, builds the compact catalog, and only then replaces `sacredmusic/`.

Run `npm run validate` after any data or importer change. Do not hand-edit generated files under `sacredmusic/`; fix the transformation and rebuild instead.

## Automation

The `Refresh and publish catalog` workflow runs daily and can be started manually. Scheduled and manual runs refresh, rebuild, validate, commit changed data, and deploy that exact snapshot. Pushes to `main` rebuild and validate without contacting the upstream service; deployment stops if the committed compact catalog is stale.

The workflow uploads only `sacredmusic/catalog/`. In repository settings, GitHub Pages must use **GitHub Actions** as its source.

## Consumer guidance

- Treat this repository as a cache that can occasionally be unavailable or stale.
- Prefer `AUDIO_VOCAL`, `AUDIO_INSTRUMENTAL`, or audience-specific vocal recordings for everyday listening. Do not assume the first recording is the best default; accompaniment is frequently first in the source data.
- Show a recording selector when multiple versions exist.
- Keep an official source link in the interface and handle removed songs or changed media URLs.
- Test browser playback, seeking, and cross-origin behavior against representative live URLs before release.
- Do not infer reuse rights from public availability. Review applicable source terms and asset-specific rights before publishing an app that uses this data or artwork.

## Maintenance notes

The importer intentionally limits concurrency and retries transient request failures. Collection pagination continues until the reported total is reached. Any incomplete or malformed collection fails the run, leaving the previously published snapshot untouched.

The raw mirror is retained as internal build input for debugging and provenance. The versioned catalog is the only supported application-facing shape. Breaking changes require a new version directory and a migration note in this README.
